subtitle: Analyze spatial omics data to identify biological modules

---
The SOTK is an R package that offers a comprehensive suite of functions for identifying biologically meaningful modules from spatial transcriptomics data. It enables integrative analysis across multiple cohorts or platforms by constructing a unified correlation network based on deconvoluted outputs, leveraging community detection algorithms to uncover overrepresented biological patterns.
