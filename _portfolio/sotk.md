subtitle: Microbiota reproducibility benchmark project

---
This project aims to systematically evaluate and optimize the experimental variables that determine successful and reproducible engraftment of human gut microbiota in germ-free mice. Through quantitative assessment of microbial and host microbiome profiles, we seek to establish evidence-based best practices for generating and validating human microbiota-associated models.
